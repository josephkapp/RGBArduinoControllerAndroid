An android app to control my neopixels connected to an ardiuno via Bluetooth LE. This app controls the code that runs on the arduino found in this repo: https://github.com/josephkapp/NeoPixel_Arduino .
The app features the same functionality as the desktop app, such as: Selecting an animation, color, animation speed, and animation direction.
